# Define hold fee so that a fully locked 1 BTC channel would yield ~8.5%
# annually.
#
# The hold fee is not actually paid by channel peers and currently only exists
# to raise awareness of the costs of long-holding htlcs.
holdFee:
  # Set the base hold fee to 500 sat per hour to compensate for the usage of an
  # htlc slot. If an imaginary channel of 1 BTC would have all of its 483 slots
  # occupied for a full year, the total hold fee would be 24 * 365 * 483 =
  # 4231080 sats. This translates to a yearly return on the staked bitcoin of
  # ~4.2%.

  # Set the hold fee rate to 5 parts per million. If an imaginary channel of 1
  # BTC would have all of its funds time-locked for a full year, the total hold
  # fee would be 24 * 365 * 100000000 * 5 / 1000000 = 4380000. This translates
  # to a yearly return on the staked bitcoin of ~4.4%.
